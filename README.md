# NoteTakingWebApp
I coded a note taking web app running on local storage using JSP and Servlets. The web app is a CRUD app allowing the creation of new notes, searching, deletion and editing of existing notes as well as sorting notes in specific orders.

The notes can be searched by keyword, which means that this keyword can be found in the title or even in the contents of the note, which makes retrieving notes very easy.

Notes can be sorted by alphabetical order, date created and date last edited.

This project makes use of Maven as build automator tool.
